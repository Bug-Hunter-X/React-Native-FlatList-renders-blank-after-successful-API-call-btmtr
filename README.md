# React Native FlatList Blank Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component renders blank even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue occurs despite seemingly correct error handling.

## Bug Description

A component fetches data from an API using `fetch`.  The response is handled correctly, and the data is successfully parsed. However, the `FlatList` component remains blank.  The console shows no errors.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains empty although API call is successful.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the data array is not null or empty before rendering the FlatList. Also ensure correct key extraction for unique items.
